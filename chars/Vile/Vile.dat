	<#009d20>UNIQUE TRAIT: ACID PUDDLES</>
	Vile can empower himself by placing and interacting with acid puddles.
	Puddles placed with Remix Moves are temporary, but puddles placed with
	EX Moves last until Vile creates a new puddle. Puddles give Vile a
	variety of benefits, so he should try to always be standing in or near one.
